# UFOs
## Overview of Project
“The Truth Is Out There” is a HTML page that was built using JavaScript data and code to see different UFO sightings throughout the United States. This HTML page has a brief description then a table that has filters for multiple criteria to allow users to do a more in-depth analysis of the data.  The filters that are available are for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
“The Truth Is Out There” HTML web page is clean, user friendly and allows users to use multiple filters to scan through data regarding UFO sightings in the United States. The top half of the page is the title then below the titles some Ufologists weigh-in on “UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?”

After the weigh-ins, there is a table that has 5 filters that users can use to narrow down the data. The filters are to help narrow down the sightings of UFOs by either date, city, state, country, and shape. The user can use either one or multiple filters to narrow down the data.

## Summary
In summary, the HTML page is clean, user-friendly and provides multiple filters to allow users easy access to data regarding UFO sightings. One drawback about the page is the data is limited. One recommendation I have is to determine a way to make the data up-to-date by allowing users to send in new sightings. I would think adding a form to the bottom of the page that allows users to submit new sightings which could be scanned by the owner of the webpage and added if it is valid. My second recommendation is to add a few fields to the data to include the time of the day when the sightings occur and what the weather was like.
